# Status Report 2: Friday, December 3

## New Tasks Accomplished
* Client Side:
  * Generating random nodes and selecting two of them at random given input values
  * returning the random nodes using promise syntax

## Hurdles Overcome:

## Next Steps
* Allow the user to drag or draw a path between the two points

* Use Directions API to find the optimal path for comparison purposes
* Data visualization (server side)
  * Generate a graph or chart to visualize the data in aggregate (this is probably easier on the server)
* Data visualization (client side)
  * Make a simple leaderboard that shows the top scores (either on a separate page or in a "pop-up")
